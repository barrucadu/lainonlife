"""Radio scheduling program.

Usage:
  schedule.py [--host=HOST] PORT

Options:
  --host=HOST  Hostname of MPD [default: localhost]
  -h --help    Show this text

Takes a port number, and does the following:

1. Sets the play order to normal, looping.
2. Clears all music before the cursor position in the playlist.
3. Appends a roughly three-hour block of music to the end of the playlist in this format:
   a. A transition track
   b. A full album
   c. Enough random tracks to make up the difference.

The new segment may be a little shorter if an exact fit is not possible, but in practice it will
be close.

Why do this?  Listening to entire albums in order is nice, as tracks in an album often build off
each other.  On the other hand, variety is also nice!
